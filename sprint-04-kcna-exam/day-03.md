Passing score: 75% (45/60)
```

&nbsp;

### Score by domain (if the mock breaks it down)

| Domain | Weight | My Score | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| K8s Fundamentals | 44% | ___% | 🟢 🟡 🔴 |
| Container Orchestration | 28% | ___% | 🟢 🟡 🔴 |
| App Delivery | 16% | ___% | 🟢 🟡 🔴 |
| Architecture | 12% | ___% | 🟢 🟡 🔴 |

&nbsp;

### What to do with your score

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│  80%+ → 🟢 You're ready. Day 4 = light     │
│            review. Consider booking exam.   │
│                                             │
│  70-79% → 🟡 Close. Day 4 = focused drill  │
│             on weak domains. Mock #2 will   │
│             push you over.                  │
│                                             │
│  Below 70% → 🔴 Needs work. Day 4 = deep   │
│               review. Add 1-2 extra days    │
│               before Mock #2. No shame.     │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

&nbsp;

### Review every wrong answer

For each question you got wrong:

1. **Read the explanation** — understand WHY the right answer is right
2. **Categorize it** — which domain? Which specific topic?
3. **Add it to your weak-areas.md** from yesterday

The questions you got wrong tell you exactly what to study. Don't waste time re-studying things you already know.
