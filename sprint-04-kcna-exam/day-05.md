## Part 2 — Score & Decision `15 min`

&nbsp;

### Record your score

```
Mock #1 score: ______%
Mock #2 score: ______%
```

&nbsp;

### The decision tree

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Mock #2 Score:                      │
│                                      │
│  75%+ → 🟢 YOU'RE READY.            │
│           Go sit the exam today.     │
│                                      │
│  70-74% → 🟡 Almost there.          │
│            Quick review of wrong     │
│            answers, then go for it.  │
│            You have a free retake.   │
│                                      │
│  Below 70% → 🔴 Take 1-2 more      │
│               drill days. No rush.   │
│               Repeat Day 4 process.  │
│               You have 12 months     │
│               to schedule the exam.  │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Real talk:** If you scored 70%+ on both mocks, you will almost certainly pass. Mock exams tend to be slightly harder than the real thing. The free retake also means the stakes are low. Go for it.
