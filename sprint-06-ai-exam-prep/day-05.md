│  EXAM STRATEGY                           │
│                                          │
│  1. Read each question carefully         │
│  2. Look for AWS service names —         │
│     they're usually the answer key       │
│  3. Eliminate 2 wrong answers first      │
│  4. If stuck → mark it and move on      │
│  5. ANSWER EVERY QUESTION (no penalty)  │
│  6. 90 min / 65 Qs = ~1.4 min each     │
│  7. Review marked questions at the end  │
│                                          │
│  COMMON PATTERNS:                        │
│  "Most cost-effective" → managed service │
│  "Least operational overhead" → Bedrock  │
│  "Need to customize model" → fine-tune   │
│  "Internal documents" → RAG              │
│  "Detect bias" → SageMaker Clarify       │
│  "Filter harmful output" → Guardrails    │

### What's Next? (Optional Capstone)

If you want to keep building, here's a capstone idea that ties everything together:

```
CAPSTONE: AI Support Assistant on Kubernetes

  An AI-powered support chatbot that:
  ├── Uses Ollama to run a local LLM
  ├── Serves it via FastAPI with /chat and /health endpoints
  ├── Deployed on Kubernetes with proper manifests
  ├── Includes health checks, resource limits, and HPA
  ├── README with architecture diagram + demo GIF
  └── Ties together: K8s + AI + Docker + Python + MLOps
```
